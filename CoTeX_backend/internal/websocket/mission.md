3. Recommended Changes for Monetization / Supabase

Right now, your scaffold doesn’t know who the user is.
If you want to enforce repo limits or pro-tier features, the backend will need user context.

Change #1: Add a Lightweight Auth Layer

    Accept Supabase JWT in Authorization header.

    Use JWKS to validate token (very simple in Go).

    Associate WebSocket clients with user_id.

    This allows:

        Broadcasting only to that user instead of all clients.

        Checking repo limits before allowing new links.

Change #2: Add a Minimal “Repo Tracking” Endpoint

    Example: POST /api/repos

    Backend stores { user_id, repo_name, webhook_secret } in Supabase DB.

    Enforce repo_limit from Supabase profiles table.

    GitHub webhooks can now map events to the correct user.
